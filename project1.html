            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the Online Bonafide Certificate Generation System, an innovative solution for streamlining the issuance of bonafide certificates. This web-based application employs a robust technology stack to provide a user-friendly and efficient experience for all stakeholders.
            </p>
            <p>
                The front end is crafted using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and the Bootstrap framework for responsive and visually appealing interfaces. On the backend, PHP handles server-side logic, and MySQL serves as the database to ensure data integrity and persistence.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Modules</h2>
            <p>
                The system comprises three interconnected modules: Student, Staff, and Head of Department (HOD). Each module plays a crucial role in the bonafide request and approval process, offering tailored functionalities to meet the needs of its users.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Student Module:</strong> This module allows students to register with their personal and academic details. The Generation form, designed using HTML and styled with CSS, ensures a smooth onboarding process. Students can log in securely using their roll number and password. The Bootstrap framework enhances the overall user interface, providing a consistent and visually appealing design.</li>
                <li><strong>Staff Module:</strong> Staff members interact with a dynamic dashboard created with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The dashboard displays pending and approved requests, along with statistics on total requests. Staff members can efficiently manage and approve bonafide requests through an intuitive and responsive interface. PHP handles server-side logic, coordinating with the MySQL database for data retrieval and storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Head of Department (HOD) Module:</strong> Similar to the Staff Module, the HOD Module provides the Head of Department with an interface to make the final decision on bonafide requests. PHP ensures secure server-side operations, and MySQL maintains data consistency. The Bootstrap framework ensures a responsive and visually appealing design for the HOD's dashboard.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Student Registration and Dashboard</h2>
            <p>
                The Student Module begins with a user-friendly registration form. HTML captures the structure of the form, CSS provides an aesthetically pleasing layout, and Bootstrap ensures responsiveness. After registration, students can securely log in using their roll number and password. The system employs PHP for server-side authentication, enhancing security measures.

            <h2>Apply Bonafide</h2>
            <p>
                Applying for a bonafide certificate is a seamless process within the system. The application form, designed using HTML and styled with CSS, allows students to specify the type of certificate, department, and reason for application. Bootstrap components enhance the form's usability. Real-time status updates are provided through PHP interactions with the MySQL database. Students can monitor the progress of their applications through the application's lifecycle.

        <section>
            <h2>Staff Panel</h2>
            <p>
                The Staff Module features a responsive and organized dashboard created with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Staff members can efficiently manage and approve bonafide requests through this interface. PHP facilitates server-side logic, ensuring secure interactions with the MySQL database. The dashboard displays pending and approved requests, and staff members can access detailed information about applying students.

        <section>
            <h2>Head of Department (HOD) Panel</h2>
            <p>
                The HOD Module mirrors the Staff Module but includes features for the Head of Department to make the final decision on bonafide requests. PHP handles server-side scripting to ensure secure interactions, and MySQL is utilized for data storage and retrieval. The Bootstrap framework maintains a consistent and visually appealing design for the HOD's dashboard.
